#summary JSR-286 Compliant RSS and Atom Feed Reader

=== Summary ===

This is a portlet which mimics the behaviour of a news feed reader, although in a portlet. The portlet uses some of the new features from the portlet 2.0 specification viz Resource Serving. The source of the portlet is available in the project's SVN repository.

For a little more detail on what the portlet is capable of doing, visit [http://blogs.sun.com/insidemyhead/entry/jsr_286_compliant_ajax_enabled my blog entry on the portlet].

The portlet is AJAX enabled and for achieving this I have used the Adobe Spry Framework. I must say I am quite impressed with the Spry framework and found it extremely easy to use. Do give it a try!
